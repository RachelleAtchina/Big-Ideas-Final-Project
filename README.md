3. Real Estate()
4. Trees([Trees.csv](https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/city-trees))
   * A data set that displays the locations of all the trees in pittsburgh and their impact on air quality.


When we set out on our journy to discover the best neighborhood in pittsburgh we narrowed our sights on metrics that would prove our neighborhood is safe, good for business, and healthy. We would analyze data sets on these metrics to make sure our best neighborhood could be indentified. Finally, these metrics will be combined and our case for which neighborhood is the best will be made!
